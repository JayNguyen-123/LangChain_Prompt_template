# LangChain_Prompt_template
A prompt is the text input that we pass to an LLM application. A prompt can have one or more elements from the following:
Context: We use contexts in prompts to provide external information to the LLM application. For instance, if we want the LLM application to analyze a text and give answers based on the information in the text, we can provide the text as context to the LLM application. Query: The text input we pass to the LLM application to get an answer is a query. The query asks a specific question to the LLM application. Instruction: Instructions instruct the LLM application on how to use the context, format the output, and process the query. For example, if we are giving a context and the query cannot be answered using the information in the context, you can instruct the LLM application to give a specific answer.
